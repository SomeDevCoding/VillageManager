# This is a Simulator for managing a Medival City

## Current Status:
### Since this is a sandbox game there is no real goal, only the ones you set yourself.
You begin with 1 village and 2 villagers (Male & Female)
Your village has 4 building lots, a forest, a stone mine and an emtpy farm

You can build a Crafter, Research Hut and a House and also demolish.
You can assign a villager to a workplace (doesn't do anything besides displaying it)
View your Inventory (Resources, Items, etc.)


### What's still left to implement (game wise)
Send a villager scouting
After assigning a villager to a workplace get the benefits (Forest -> Wood, Crafter -> Items, etc.)
Equip a villager with items
Expand buildings (currently only "Gen1 Buildings")
Defend your village against attacks
move on to the next age (new items, buildings, enemies, etc.)


### What's still left to implement (code wise)
A LOT OF Clean coding (refactoring, scalable, etc.)
General terminal design etique (eg. coloring, text display, etc.)
